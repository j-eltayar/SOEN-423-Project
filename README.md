# SOEN-423-Project

## Introduction

### Scope

A distributed room reservation system (DRRS) that will contain multiple servers. Utilizing Corba, the system will allow a Student or Administrator to create, delete and book various rooms based on their permission. Interacting and manipulating the data structure/base of each server accordingly. The goal is to demonstrate a distributed system where all the servers act as a unified and integrated application. 


As an added level of complexity, our group will also be implementing an active replication protocol to our server system to be software failure tolerant and crash failure tolerant with each location having 4 replicas of the server. These failure tolerance capabilities will then be tested through a series of test scenarios to validate their robustness. 

### Technologies Used

The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) standard is deployed in a Wide Area Network (WAN). The system was implemented using this standard as it allows for methods to be interacted with and invoked remotely, attaining the client-server relationship required for our application.
